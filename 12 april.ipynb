    "One real-world application of bagging in machine learning is in the field of finance for predicting stock prices. \n",
    "The stock market is highly volatile and predicting the stock prices accurately is a challenging task. In such cases, bagging techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions.\n",

    "Bagging can be used to build multiple decision tree models on bootstrap samples of the historical stock prices data. \n",

    "For example, the Random Forest algorithm, which is a bagging ensemble of decision trees, has been used in finance for predicting stock prices. \n",

Bagging reduces variance by training multiple decision trees on different bootstrap samples of the training set and averaging their predictions.
